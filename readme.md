In this particular code i have used ' INDIAN STARTUPS DATASET '. on the top of it i have done little bit analysis & i have converted that analysis into the streamlit website and i am Visualizing that through the website which is app.py file .
to run the website you need to open app.py file and you need to go on terminal and on terminal you need to give command (streamlit run app.py) after doing this you will enter into the streamlit website page and from there you can all te Visualization which have done by me .
Thanks you so much
